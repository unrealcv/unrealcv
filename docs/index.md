<h1>Introduction</h1>

UnrealCV helps computer vision researchers build virtual worlds using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). It extends UE4 with a plugin by providing:

1. a set of UnrealCV commands to interact with the virtual world
2. Communication between UE4 and an external program, such as Caffe or tensorflow.

Currently, UnrealCV plugin supports UE4 (4.12, 4.13, 4.14) in Windows, Linux and Mac. UnrealCV client supports python and MATLAB (experimental). Read [getting started](getting-started.md) to learn how to use UnrealCV.
